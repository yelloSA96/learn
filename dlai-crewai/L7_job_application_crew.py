# # L7: Build a Crew to Tailor Job Applications
# 
# In this lesson, you will built your first multi-agent system.

# The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
# ```Python
# !pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
# ```
# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


# - Import libraries, APIs and LLM
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew


# **Note**: 
# - The video uses `gpt-4-turbo`, but due to certain constraints, and in order to offer this course for free to everyone, the code you'll run here will use `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
# - You can use `gpt-4-turbo` when you run the notebook _locally_ (using `gpt-4-turbo` will not work on the platform)
# - Thank you for your understanding!
