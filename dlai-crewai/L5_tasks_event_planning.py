# In this lesson, you will learn more about Tasks.

# The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
# ```Python
# !pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
# ```
# Warning control

# **Note**: 
# - The video uses `gpt-4-turbo`, but due to certain constraints, and in order to offer this course for free to everyone, the code you'll run here will use `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
# - You can use `gpt-4-turbo` when you run the notebook _locally_ (using `gpt-4-turbo` will not work on the platform)
# - Thank you for your understanding!

# Agent 1: Venue Coordinator

    "based on event requirements",
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool],

# ## Creating Venue Pydantic Object
# 
# - Create a class `VenueDetails` using [Pydantic BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/).
# - Agents will populate this object with information about different venues by creating different instances of it.

from pydantic import BaseModel
# Define a Pydantic model for venue details 
# (demonstrating Output as Pydantic) The agent will fill out these details
class VenueDetails(BaseModel):
    name: str
    address: str
    capacity: int
    booking_status: str


# ## Creating Tasks
# - By using `output_json`, you can specify the structure of the output you want.
# - By using `output_file`, you can get your output in a file.
# - By setting `human_input=True`, the task will ask for human feedback (whether you like the results or not) before finalising it.

# This tasks isn't asynchronous and because it isn't, it is sequentially a bottleneck to be completed first
venue_task = Task(
    description="Find a venue in {event_city} "
                "that meets criteria for {event_topic}.",
    expected_output="All the details of a specifically chosen"
                    "venue you found to accommodate the event.",
    human_input=True,   # Human input now in the task
    output_json=VenueDetails,
    output_file="venue_details.json",  
      # Outputs the venue details as a JSON file
    agent=venue_coordinator
)


# - By setting `async_execution=True`, it means the task can run in parallel with the tasks which come after it.
logistics_task = Task(
    description="Coordinate catering and "
                 "equipment for an event "
                 "with {expected_participants} participants "
                 "on {tentative_date}.",
    expected_output="Confirmation of all logistics arrangements "
                    "including catering and equipment setup.",

    async_execution=True, # Run independently on it's own

    expected_output="Report on marketing activities "
                    "and attendee engagement formatted as markdown.",
    async_execution=True,
    output_file="marketing_report.md",  # Outputs the report as a text file
    agent=marketing_communications_agent
)
# **Note**: Since you set `async_execution=True` for `logistics_task` and `marketing_task` tasks, now the order for them does not matter in the `tasks` list.
# Define the crew with agents and tasks

    agents=[venue_coordinator, 
            logistics_manager,

           logistics_task, 
           marketing_task], # The roder of these tasks doesn't matter since async has been set
    
    verbose=True
)
# ## Running the Crew
# 
# - Set the inputs for the execution of the crew.

# **Note 1**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.
# **Note 2**: 
# - Since you set `human_input=True` for some tasks, the execution will ask for your input before it finishes running.
# - When it asks for feedback, use your mouse pointer to first click in the text box before typing anything.

result = event_management_crew.kickoff(inputs=event_details)


# - Display the generated `venue_details.json` file.
import json
from pprint import pprint

with open('venue_details.json') as f:
   data = json.load(f)

pprint(data)


# - Display the generated `marketing_report.md` file.
# 
# **Note**: After `kickoff` execution has successfully ran, wait an extra 45 seconds for the `marketing_report.md` file to be generated. If you try to run the code below before the file has been generated, your output would look like:
# 
# ```
# marketing_report.md
# ```
# 
# If you see this output, wait some more and than try again.
