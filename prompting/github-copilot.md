# GitHub Co-pilot Prompting

## Improvements 
- [x] Using `/fixit`

## Production
When you are wanting to apply a new concept but keeping it production relevant is important for scalability.

`How would this <concept> be used in production? What are some best practices used for this?`


## Explaination

| Prompt | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Could you explain line by line. Providing examples and what is done in best practice. <br> Audience: Knowledgeable in devOps engineering with some basic understanding of what bash can do. | | 
| (Some Topic) <br> Let's discuss about the design and when I say "generate code for me", you can then generate the code. | This will help iron out the details before jumping into the code straight away| 
| Expanation Only: <topic/question> | From the looks of it, Co-pilot continuously wants to spit out code and with this, it shares only the explanation and nothing additional on top of that <br> Yet to determine consistency and how long this tag is persisted in the conversation? | 
| Show my the difference only and nothing more. <br> Add topic here | When the code is shared, for most of the time, it will share the entire code snippets again and again. This will share you the important changes required |
