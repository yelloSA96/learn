# [I Quit My $150,000 Corporate Job After Learning 3 Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPnT_lQKh7A&t=410s)
The video is a personal narrative about the creator's decision to reject a prestigious corporate job offer at 20 years old in favor of pursuing his own path, which he considers the best decision of his life. He shares three key lessons he learned through this experience:

1. **Discovering Who You Are**: Many people end up in jobs they don’t like because they let others' opinions influence their decisions. The speaker emphasizes that it's important to self-reflect and understand what makes you happy, rather than simply accepting societal expectations.

2. **Figuring Out What You Want**: Through journaling and self-reflection, the speaker realized that he didn’t truly want the corporate job and that his desires were different from those around him. He highlights the importance of speaking with others to gain perspective and clarify your own goals.

3. **Learning How to Get What You Want**: The speaker outlines three strategies for achieving personal goals: embracing a mindset shift (taking risks), recognizing one's privileges, and setting proper goals. He encourages breaking down long-term goals into daily tasks, which makes the journey more manageable.

The overall message is about taking risks, understanding oneself, and pursuing a life aligned with personal values and passions, rather than staying in the comfort zone of corporate work. The speaker concludes by affirming that finding the answers to these three questions—who you are, what you want, and how to get it—leads to a fulfilling life.
